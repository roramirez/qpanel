# This file for Docker is thanks by @litnimax
# Is adapted to use Python 3 (The support for Python 2 was removed)
# You can find about this in https://github.com/roramirez/qpanel/issues/195
# If have any improved about this add a Pull Request o Issue.
#
# Maybe using a docker-compose would be fine in the future. Only add this in QPanel for
# for all dockerized users around the all shipping containers in the world.
